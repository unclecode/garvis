# Garvis (Starts with G)

## This README is a work in progress. Please check back soon for more information.

Welcome to Garvis! This project leverages the speech-to-text endpoint from Groq, utilizing their cutting-edge LPU (Language Processing Unit) chips, which offer unprecedented speed, faster than traditional GPUs. The goal of Garvis is to provide a near real-time user experience by chunking based on silence and translating instantly, thanks to the high-speed capabilities of Groq's hardware and the LLAMA3 large language model.

## Features

- **Real-Time Translation**: By chunking input based on silence, Garvis can translate in near real-time, providing an almost instantaneous user experience.
- **Asynchronous Core Library**: The core of Garvis, named "jarvis", is built to be asynchronous, making it adaptable to various user interfaces.
- **Flexible User Interface**: Garvis is designed to be user interface agnostic, allowing it to be integrated into any platform. Currently, there are examples for both a desktop application and a terminal interface.

## Repository Structure

- **examples/**: Contains example implementations of Garvis.
  - **desktop/**: A simple desktop application showcasing Garvis in action.
  - **terminal/**: A sample of using the Garvis library in a terminal environment.
